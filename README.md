This is an educational website that teaches the basics of C++ structures, classes and stacks in Bulgarian. I made it in 2010, back when I was still in high school. The website has a hidden menu on the left of the page, examples and downloadable content (.cpp programs that I wrote), it also has some fun pictures that I made with Adobe Photoshop and smiley gifs to raise the good vibes.
